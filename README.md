# Pocket Sense

A Collaborative Project by Team Techno Spirits for Crypto Shield Hackathon

Pocket Sense is a comprehensive financial literacy platform designed to empower users with personalized insights and actionable data for informed financial decision-making. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Pocket Sense offers a suite of tools for expense tracking, investment management, debt reduction, and community-driven financial discussions.

## Key Features and Problem-Solving Approaches

### 1. Personalized Investment Suggestions
- Users take a quiz to receive tailored investment plans based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferred investment timeframe.
- Utilizes machine learning models like Decision Trees (initial plan), Random Forests, and K-Means Clustering for accurate suggestions.

### 2. Expense Tracking with Dynamic Budgeting
- Logs daily expenses, categorizes them, and generates budget templates.
- Employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict future expenses and provide real-time budget adjustments.

### 3. Investment Portfolio Management
- Consolidates user investments and forecasts future returns using Bayesian Networks and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Helps users assess risk and make data-driven decisions about their investment portfolios.

### 4. Group Expense Manager
- Allows users to log group expenses, automatically splits bills among participants.
- Tracks contributions and calculates outstanding amounts using Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Rule-Based AI Systems.

### 5. EMI Calculator
- Provides a simple mathematical formula for calculating loan repayments.
- Helps users understand their financial commitments based on expense data from the Expense Tracker before taking a loan.

### 6. Real-Time Chat Room
- Enables users to engage in discussions on market trends, share investment strategies, and get advice on portfolio management.
- Fosters community interaction and crowd-sourced insights into investment opportunities.
