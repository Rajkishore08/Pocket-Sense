# Pocket Sense

A Collaborative Project by Team Techno Spirits for Crypto Shield Hackathon

Pocket Sense is a comprehensive financial literacy platform designed to empower users with personalized insights and actionable data for informed financial decision-making. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Pocket Sense offers a suite of tools for expense tracking, investment management, debt reduction, and community-driven financial discussions.

## Key Features and Problem-Solving Approaches

1. **Personalized Investment Suggestions**
   - Users take a quiz to receive tailored investment plans based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferred investment timeframe.
   - Utilizes machine learning models like Decision Trees (initial plan), Random Forests, and K-Means Clustering for accurate suggestions.

2. **Expense Tracking with Dynamic Budgeting**
   - Logs daily expenses, categorizes them, and generates budget templates.
   - Employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict future expenses and provide real-time budget adjustments.

3. **Investment Portfolio Management**
   - Consolidates user investments and forecasts future returns using Bayesian Networks and Monte Carlo simulations.
   - Helps users assess risk and make data-driven decisions about their investment portfolios.

4. **Group Expense Manager**
   - Allows users to log group expenses, automatically splits bills among participants.
   - Tracks contributions and calculates outstanding amounts using Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Rule-Based AI Systems.

5. **EMI Calculator**
   - Provides a simple mathematical formula for calculating loan repayments.
   - Helps users understand their financial commitments based on expense data from the Expense Tracker before taking a loan.

6. **Real-Time Chat Room**
   - Enables users to engage in discussions on market trends, share investment strategies, and get advice on portfolio management.
   - Fosters community interaction and crowd-sourced insights into investment opportunities.
