Pocket Sense
A Collaborative Project by Team Techno Spirits for Crypto Shield Hackathon
Pocket Sense is a comprehensive financial literacy platform designed to empower users with personalized insights and actionable data for informed financial decision-making. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Pocket Sense offers a suite of tools for expense tracking, investment management, debt reduction, and community-driven financial discussions.
Key Features and Problem-Solving Approaches
Personalized Investment Suggestions:
Users take a quiz to receive tailored investment plans based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferred investment timeframe.
Utilizes machine learning models like Decision Trees (initial plan), Random Forests, and K-Means Clustering for accurate suggestions.
Expense Tracking with Dynamic Budgeting:
Logs daily expenses, categorizes them, and generates budget templates.
Employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict future expenses and provide real-time budget adjustments.
Investment Portfolio Management:
Consolidates user investments and forecasts future returns using Bayesian Networks and Monte Carlo simulations.
Helps users assess risk and make data-driven decisions about their investment portfolios.
Group Expense Manager:
Allows users to log group expenses, automatically splits bills among participants.
Tracks contributions and calculates outstanding amounts using Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Rule-Based AI Systems.
EMI Calculator:
Provides a simple mathematical formula for calculating loan repayments.
Helps users understand their financial commitments based on expense data from the Expense Tracker before taking a loan.
Real-Time Chat Room:
Enables users to engage in discussions on market trends, share investment strategies, and get advice on portfolio management.
Fosters community interaction and crowd-sourced insights into investment opportunities.
